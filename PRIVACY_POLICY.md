# Privacy Policy for JS Recon Buddy

> Last Updated: September 24, 2025

Thank you for using JS Recon Buddy. This Privacy Policy is intended to be as simple and transparent as possible. Your privacy is a top priority, and this policy explains what data the extension interacts with and why certain permissions are necessary for it to function.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

JS Recon Buddy does not collect, store, share, or transmit any of your personal data, browsing history, or any other user-specific information.

All scanning and analysis performed by the extension happens entirely locally on your computer within your browser. The findings and data generated by the extension are stored locally on your machine using the browser's storage APIs and are never sent to any external server or third party.

## 2. Permissions and Justifications

JS Recon Buddy requires certain permissions to provide its security analysis features. We are committed to using these permissions only for the purposes described below.

- Host Permissions (<all_urls>): As a security analysis tool, the extension's core function is to scan the websites you visit for potential secrets and endpoints. This permission is fundamental, allowing the extension to access the content (HTML and JavaScript) of any page you navigate to in order to perform its analysis locally.

- `activeTab`: This permission is used to get the URL of the tab you are currently viewing. This allows the popup to display the correct scan results for that specific page and enables user-initiated actions like the "Analyze Full Page" feature.

- `scripting`: This is the primary mechanism for analysis. The extension uses this permission to inject a local script into the webpage to read its source code. This script gathers the data needed for the scan without sending any information externally. It is also used to update the tab's title with a count of findings for immediate visual feedback.

- `storage` and `unlimitedStorage`: The extension uses the browser's local storage to improve your experience. `storage.session` is used to cache scan results for a tab, preventing redundant scans. `storage.local` is used for settings, such as an ignore list, and to cache version information. Since web applications can have very large source files, `unlimitedStorage` is required to ensure the extension can function correctly without failing due to storage limits.

- `tabs`: This permission allows the extension to know which tab is currently active so it can update its icon and badge with the correct scan status. It also uses tab events to trigger scans when you switch to or update a tab.

- `webNavigation`: To work effectively on modern websites, the extension uses this permission to detect when a page has completely finished loading (onCompleted) or when a navigation event occurs within a Single Page Application (onHistoryStateUpdated), ensuring that scans are always timely and accurate.

- `offscreen` (Chrome/Chromium-based only): The scanning process can be CPU-intensive. This permission is used to run the heavy scanning logic in a separate, hidden document. This prevents the extension's main processes from slowing down and ensures the user interface remains fast and responsive at all times.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The extension may make a network request to [the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheArqsz/JSRecon-Buddy) to check if a new version is available. This is a read-only operation and sends no user data.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in this document and updating the "Last Updated" date.
